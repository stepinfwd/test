        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Coming from a middle-class family, I grew up in a relatively decent
          household. My dad worked hard starting from scratch, gradually making
          his way up to provide for his household while my mum worked hard at
          home taking care of the household and raising 2 boys. They tried their
          best to give us a good life. Thank God, I’ve never had to experience
          what it's like to go to bed hungry until I had become an adult, and
          until I had to leave the nest of my parents to build my own only to
          realise how naïve I’ve been about adulthood and the world outside my
          home. <br /> <br /> I realised that life was not easy and that you
          have to pave your own path. Well, that wasn’t pretty easy either,
          learning to navigate through conflicts in relationships, and getting
          rid of unhealthy habits that stood between me and the person I wanted
          to become. There were plenty of things that I wished I had the support
          and guidance for. <br /> <br />I did seek out support, be it by paying
          thousands of pounds for coaching, or counselling, or by working hard
          on self-improvement. And I did learn a lot through these valuable
          experiences. However, there was an important aspect that was missing.
          I wasn’t able to get what I wanted from those sessions. On one hand,
          counselling alone didn’t provide me with the tools to thrive in life,
          nor did it push and motivate me to seek constant improvement on its
          own. On the other, I wasn’t able to make the best use of the coaching
          sessions as I felt that the core beliefs I held from my past
          experiences constrained me.
          <br /> <br />
          <span className="golden">
            But… Let's say the situation was slightly different.{" "}
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine having a coach out there to help you overcome your hurdles and
          help you achieve your full potential in areas that need improvement,
          who is also trained to help you identify past experiences that may
          have shaped you and holds you back in the present. A two-in-one
          experience, that can be more instrumental in your change and also help
          you save more money.
          <br /> <br /> Having been in the coaching field for the past 3 years,
          coaching the youth mainly through teenage crises, transitioning to
          adulthood, relationship dynamics, and addiction recovery coaching,
          doubled with my training in counselling and psychotherapy across three
          modalities, I believe that I have something solid to offer you.
          <br /> <br /> Can you see yourself making the best of this life and
          the next? Then what’s stopping you from taking action? <br /> <br />
          If you’d like to embrace the journey of self-exploration and
          improvement I’d like to invite you to have a 40 min free consultation
          to work out whether we are the perfect fit for each other. Oh yes!,
          That’s important. The working relationship is the most crucial factor
          in predicting results. <br /> <br /> I’ll see you soon.

          <p>
            I specialize in empowering the youth to overcome relationship
            difficulties, struggles with addiction and regain discipline and
            motivation to lead purpose driven lives within an entirely
            confidential setting.

            Being in your 20’s in the 21st century could undoubtedly be one of
            the best times to be alive, with the vast opportunities to learn,
            earn and turn your life around. But even with so much happening,
            surviving in this era can surely be daunting. Relationships that are
            only meaningful to the extent of social media, companies willing to
            go to any extreme to gain our attention, realities that are painful,
            ugly, boring and endless matters to get addicted to, and much more,
            all just to escape this reality.
